# Watson Feedback API

Watson Feedback API is part of a two-part application for hosting on Bluemix. It is a simple API created using Node-RED to act as a backend that speaks to Watson-Feedback-Board.

The Application is combined with Watson Feedback Board to be a simple demonstration of the possibilities that the Watson Tone Analysis API represents.
